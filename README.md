This is my second interation of my portfolio.
It is used for applying for jobs, and getting the attention of posible employers by showing off your work.

Due to this being GPL v3 licnesed anyone can fork this repo and use it for their personal use!

How to Set Up:

If you want the base Project with none of my information, I highly recomend looking at rammcodes oringal version at https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio 
It has all the information you will need to setting it properly, but if you wish to clone mine the instructions are down below!

Instrucitons:

$ git clone https://github.com/SethY8s/portflio2.git

$ cd portfolio2

$ git remote remove origin

Install dependencies and styling

$ npm install

$ npm run compile:scss

This is just the basic run down, again I highly recommend you checkout rammcodes version for better instructions and a blank template.

Notiable changes added to my fork include, about me page, animated gifs, and modified components.
